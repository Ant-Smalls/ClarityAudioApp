## Features to Implement & Improvements

### 1. üìÅ Database Integration
**Objective:** Store and organize saved transcription+translation sessions locally.

#### Tasks:
- Integrate **SQLite** with the project.
- Create a **RecordingContainer** model to hold:
  - Original audio filename
  - Transcript
  - Translated text
  - Timestamp
  - Custom user-defined name
- Implement **CRUD functionality**:
  - Save new containers
  - Delete containers
  - Rename containers
- Build a **Library view page** to show saved containers in a scrollable list.

### Database Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Basic Setup & Model Creation
- Set up SQLite integration
- Create RecordingSession model with:
  ```swift
  struct RecordingSession {
      let id: UUID
      let name: String
      let dateCreated: Date
      let duration: TimeInterval
      let audioFileName: String
      let sourceLanguage: String
      let targetLanguage: String
      let transcription: String
      let translation: String
  }
  ```
- Create DatabaseManager singleton
- Test: Verify database connection and table creation

#### Phase 2: Basic CRUD Operations
- Implement core database operations:
  - Create: Save new recording session
  - Read: Fetch single session by ID
  - Update: Update session name
  - Delete: Remove session and associated audio
- Create AudioFileManager for handling audio files
- Test: Verify each CRUD operation individually

#### Phase 3: Library View Integration
- Create basic Library view 
- Implement fetch all recordings functionality
- Add sorting (by date, name)
- Display recordings in list format
- Test: Verify UI displays database contents correctly

#### Phase 4: Recording Integration
- Modify RecordView to save sessions after translation
- Connect audio file saving with database entry
- Implement proper error handling
- Test: Complete recording-to-library workflow

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Add search functionality
- Implement batch operations (delete multiple)
- Add recording categories/tags
- Add recording favorites
- Test: Verify all features with various data sets

#### Testing Checkpoints
After each phase:
1. Database integrity
2. Data persistence across app restarts
3. Audio file management
4. Memory management
5. Error handling
6. UI responsiveness
7. Edge cases (empty states, large datasets)

#### Rollback Plan
- Create backup methods for database
- Implement data migration strategies
- Plan for schema updates

### 2. üó£Ô∏è Transcription Process
**Objective:** Improve usability by eliminating the need to manually select the input language.

#### Tasks:
- Use **language auto-detection** in the transcription API or integrate a separate auto-detect model pre-call.
- Fallback to user-selected language if auto-detection fails or confidence score is low.

---

### 3. üåç Translation Process
**Objective:** Add support for Serbian if possible.

#### Tasks:
- Check if Apple's translation API or the current translation provider supports Serbian.

---

### 4. üß≠ UI Navigation
**Objective:** Make the app intuitive and polished with clear navigation.

#### Tasks:
- Implement a **bottom tab navigation** system with 3 pages:
  - üåê Languages page (icon: globe)
  - üéôÔ∏è Record page (icon: microphone)
  - üìö Library page (icon: book or folder)
- Each page should be clearly separated and maintainable in its own view file.

---

### 5. üßπ Project Cleanup
**Objective:** Improve file organization and maintainability.

#### Tasks:
- Organize files into clean folders:
  - `views/` ‚Äì all screen components (Record, Library, Languages)
  - `models/` ‚Äì data models (e.g., RecordingContainer)
  - `database/` ‚Äì SQLite setup and utility functions
  - `assets/` ‚Äì icons, images, and static content
  - `components/` ‚Äì reusable UI elements like buttons, cards
- Rename files for clarity and consistent naming conventions.
- Document components with JSDoc or comments for clarity.

---

## Implementation Plan (Suggested Order)

1. **Project Cleanup** ‚Äì clean file structure first to avoid tech debt.
2. **Add SQLite and Models** ‚Äì build the data model and database logic.
3. **Create Library Page** ‚Äì implement UI for browsing saved sessions.
4. **Add CRUD Functionality** ‚Äì wire save/delete/rename to database.
5. **Integrate Language Auto-Detection** ‚Äì improve the transcription flow.
6. **Update UI with Bottom Tabs** ‚Äì connect 3-page navigation.
7. **Check & Add Serbian Translation Support** ‚Äì fallback if unsupported.


## üéôÔ∏è Save Recording Flow

**Goal:** Once recording stops, allow the user to save the session into the SQLite database as a named container.

### Steps:

1. After `stopRecording()`, show a **"Save Recording"** button.
2. On click, prompt user to **enter a custom name** (use modal or input dialog).
3. On confirm:
   - Validate name input (not empty).
   - Create a `RecordingContainer` object with:
     - Name
     - Transcription
     - Translation
     - Timestamp
   - Save the container to the **SQLite database**.
4. Refresh the **Library View** so the new container appears immediately.
5. Add **error handling**:
   - Show a message if saving fails.
   - Prevent duplicate or empty names if needed.


   ## üó£Ô∏è Eleven Labs Voice Synthesis Integration

**Goal:** Use Eleven Labs to convert translated text into audio and play it back via a "Play Translation" button.

### Steps:

1. After translation is complete:
   - Send **translated text** to the Eleven Labs API.
   - Set desired **voice ID** (can be default or user-selectable in future).
   - Configure request with appropriate **stability**, **clarity**, and **model** params.

2. On API success:
   - Receive **audio file (MP3 or WAV)** as a response.
   - Store audio in temporary local storage (e.g., cache directory).
   - Set a flag `isAudioReady = true`.

3. In the Record View:
   - Add a **"Play Translation"** button below transcript display.
   - Initially disable the button (`isAudioReady = false`).
   - Once audio is ready, **light up/enable** the button.

4. On button click:
   - Use relevant audio player to **play the audio** file.

5. Add **error handling**:
   - Handle failed API requests gracefully.
   - Optionally show a loading spinner or "Generating audio..." feedback.
