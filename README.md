#### The Challenge
A Spanish-speaking patient in Hartford Hospital's ICU needs to communicate vital information to English-speaking medical staff while wearing a CPAP mask. Traditional translation methods are slow and impersonal, potentially delaying critical care.

#### Clarity Solution

2. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Spanish speech is instantly transcribed
   - Text is accurately translated to English
   - Translation is voiced in patient's own cloned voice
3. **Clear Communication**: Medical staff hear the patient's concerns in clear English, maintaining the patient's own voice
4. **Documentation**: All interactions are saved for:
   - Medical records
   - Treatment history
   - Care analysis
   - Family updates

#### Benefits
- **Immediate Communication**: No waiting for translators
- **Personal Connection**: Patient's voice is preserved
- **Medical Accuracy**: Clear, precise translations of symptoms and concerns
- **Documentation**: Complete record of patient-staff communication
- **Reduced Anxiety**: Patients can express themselves naturally
- **Better Care**: Staff can respond quickly to patient needs
